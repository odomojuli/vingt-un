# Blackjack Basic Rules

## Objective
The main objective of Blackjack is to accumulate cards with point totals as close to 21 without going over 21. The value of cards with numbers 2 - 10 are equal to their numerical value. Kings, Queens, and Jacks are each worth 10, and Aces can count as either 1 or 11.

## The Deal
- The game starts with the player and the dealer each receiving two cards.
- One dealer card is placed face up, and the other face down. The face-down card is known as the 'hole card'.
- All player cards are dealt face up.

## Playing the Game
- Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands ('hit').
- Once satisfied with his hand, the player can 'stand', choosing not to receive any additional cards.
- If the total value of the player's cards exceeds 21, the player 'busts' and loses the bet.

## The Dealer's Play
- After the player has completed their actions, the dealer will reveal the 'hole card'.
- The dealer must hit until the cards total 17 or more points.

## Winning
- If the dealer busts and the player doesn't, the player wins.
- If the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand (without exceeding 21), the player wins.
- If the total points are equal, it is a 'push', and the player’s bet is returned.

## Payouts
- Winning players receive a payout of 1:1 on their bet.
- Achieving Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card as the initial two cards) typically pays 3:2.
